                            These adorable little mammals are rarely seen living in Zion. These creatures are related to the raccoon
                            and are nocturnal and extremely shy. They are pretty small, weighing 2 pounds and reaching 32 inches in length
                            without the bushy tail.

                            These buck-toothed animals live on the Virgin River in burrows located on the banks of the river.
                            Their signature dams are not present as the river's flooding washes away all of their hard work. Beavers
                            can have two to three kits (babies) that mature in about 2 years.
