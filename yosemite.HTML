                        The only animals in Yosemite located on the endangered species list, the Sierra Nevada Bighorn Sheep tend
                        to live in the highest areas in the park. The rams (aka male sheep) can have horns that weigh up to
                        30 pounds that they will head-butt each other with!

                            These common creatures are the only deer to call Yosemite their home. They are surprisingly fast and
                            are capable of reaching speeds up to 45 miles per hour. They also can jump 2 feet high and 12 feet in 
                            any direction.

                            There elusive animals are vital to the ecosystem in Yosemite because they keep the rodent population down.
                            They are rather small, only 8 to 33 pounds and ranging from 25 to 42 inches in length. They are very fast
                            and can chase down a rabbit by going up to 30 miles per hour.

                                Although similar, Black Bears are much smaller than their grizzlier relatives. Black Bears are
                                very opportunistic, meaning that that they eat what's available. For example, Black Bear eat berries, 
                                grasses, roots, fish, mammals, and human food.
