                            These deer are some of the largest mammals in Crater Lake. They are surprisingly fast and
                            are capable of reaching speeds up to 45 miles per hour. They also can jump 2 feet high and 12 feet in 
                            any direction.

                            Salmons are very interesting fish. They are born in rivers and streams, then they travel out to sea. However, 
                            these strange fish, ranging from 3 to 126 pounds, then return to their birth river to spawn after living in the sea. 
                            Female salmon can carry between 1,500 to 10,000 eggs!

                                The Pika is a pretty small mammal, related to rabbits but looking and weighing about the same as hamsters.
                                These small creatures are only 162 to 216 milimeters long and weigh about 100 grams. These little creatures
                                live in rocky areas and in the mountains.

                            Rainbow trouts are a very interesting type of fish. Not only did the largest Rainbow Trout ever weigh 48 pounds, but these
                            fish are also carnivores and will eat almost anything they can get their jaws on. These fish mainly eat aquatic insects, but 
                            they are also known to eat smaller fish, fish eggs, crayfish, and shrimp.
