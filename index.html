            National Parks are beautiful pieces of land that have been set aside by the government for
            preservation. National parks were originally created by US President Ulysses S. Grant in 1870
            to protect the nature and wildlife residing there. In my life, I have visited more than 20
            national parks, all of which were different in stunning ways. Yellowstone is home to some of the 
            largest and prettiest gysers in the entire world, Yosemite's wildlife and natural beauty is
            also uncomparable. The Grand Tetons huge mountains are reflected in the various bodies of water
            around the base and the Great Sand Dunes are constantly moving and changing, but always a sight to behold.
            I could not be more grateful for President Grant and the incredible actions he did to preserve these
            places. National parks are unique in their attractions, but all provide unforgettable and 
            incredible memories that can last a lifetime. For more information visit <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/national-park">Britannica</a>
