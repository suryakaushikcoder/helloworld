            <p class="paragraph">
                Yellowstone is full of various different kinds of wildlife. Ranging from the Grizzly and Black bears
                to the massive bison that roam the open landscape. For more information hover over each animal photo.

                        Yellowstone is the only place where bison have roamed free for thousands of years
                        ago and their numbers are currently at about 4000 bison. These incredible creatures
                        are the largest mammals in North America and can run up to 35 miles per hour!

                            Grizzly bears are rather intimidating creatures. They have finger-sized claws and can
                            run up to speeds of 40 miles per hour! About 700 of these animals roam around the Yellowstone
                            area and, fortunately, they prefer moths, berries, and fish over tourists.

                            Pronghorns are super cool-looking animals. They are the fastest land animals in 
                            North America and can run up to 60 miles per hour! They are also the most numerous species
                            at Yellowstone with their population exceeding 500,000 Pronghorns.

                                Although similar, Black Bears are much smaller than their grizzlier relatives. Black Bears are
                                very opportunistic, meaning that that they eat what's available. For example, Black Bear eat berries, 
                                grasses, roots, fish, mammals, and human food.

                            After nearly becoming extinct, Grey Wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone in 1995. These wolves can run
                            up to 40 miles per hour, but they normally just run at 5 miles per hour. They also hunt within a 50 square
                            to over 1000 square mile territory.

                                Moose are actually much bigger than most people think, ranging from 5 to 6.5 feet tall not including the 
                                head or antlers. They eat 73 pounds of food in the summer and 34 pounds in the winter consisting of an assortment
                                of vegetation. Interestingly enough, a moose's antlers can weigh 40 pounds!
